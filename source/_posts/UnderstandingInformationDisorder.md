## Compressed article
### Introduction
Our information ecosystem is dividing rather than connecting us.  
Imposter websites, sock puppet account, click farms, conspiracy communities are harming the ecosyFacebook down-ranked sites that used clickbait headlines. stem of information.  
This kind of information is neither "fake" nor "news".  
The term "fake news" has been used by politicians. This, together with fact that the term fails to discribe real world, are the two reason we abandon this term.  
Agents of disinformation have learned that using genuine content — reframed in new and misleading ways — is less likely to get picked up by AI systems.  
Use accurate terms. Propaganda, lies, conspiracies, rumors, hoaxes, hyper-partisan content, falsehoods or manipulated media. Disinformation, misinformation or malinformation. Collectively, INFORMATION DISORDER.  
Misinformation: FALSE
Maliinformaliton: HARM
Disinformation: BOTH
Disinfromation is created to make money or have political influence etc.  
Disinformation turns to misinformation when shared by an individual who does not realize the falseness of the piece of information.  
People share misinformation to satisfy their need to feel connected with their tribe.  
Malinformation is something genuine but intent to harm, such as the email leak from Hillary Clinton's.  
Warped and reframed genuine content is successful in terms of persuading and engaging people.  
This evolution in malinformation is useful to avoid fact check, and this is partly a response to the policy of social media companies.  
Conclusion: The threat mainly comes from malinformation.  
There are 7 types of mis-/disinformation: Satire or Parody, False Connection, Misleading Content, False Context, Imposter Content, Manipulated Content, Fabricated Content. This is first published by First Draft in Feb 2017, and it helps people understand the ecosystem.  
We will go through the 7 types one by one.  
### Satire or Parody
Satire can pass fact checkers and any push back can be dismissed by stating that it was never meant to be serious.  
Satire is becoming increasingly hateful, polarizing and divisive.  
Satire is powerful because people cannot understand it as satire when it gets re-shared.  
On social media, the heuristics are missing because lack of background of a message.  
There are lots of satirical sites inside and outside Ameirica.  
In France, satire was used for political attacks.  
Three steps:  
- a satirical site said Macron feels dirty after touching poor people's hands.
- hyper-partisan facebook pages used this to create new reports, including footage showing Macron was wiping his hands during his visit to a factory.  
- the video went viral and the cycle continued
This also happen in Brazil and America.  
Some jokes from Donald Trump are twisted to deliberately decieve readers.  
It is interesting that although some satire sites claim that they are not telling the truth, even post racist, bigoted, offensive articles, people keep following it.  
Conclusion:  
Satire is becoming increasingly hateful, polarizing and divisive, and has become a common category of information disorder.  
### False Connection
News industry need to promote quality of the produced content. Or it might damage the image of journalists.  
"clickbait" can drive down trust in the Fourth Estate.  
These techniques is useful in the short term, but will be harmful in the long term.  
These techniques to attract wider audience can be considered as a kind of information disorder.  
Facebook down-ranked sites that used clickbait headlines. Another study shows that headlines can affect a person's attitude towards the relevant project and production.  
Techniques like clickbait will never disappear as long as it can drive traffic in the short term.  
### Misleading Content
Misleading content is not new. Reframing stories in headlines, using fragments of quotes, citing part of the statistics, not covering something, etc. It is underhanded but everyone has the intent to do so.
